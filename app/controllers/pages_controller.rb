You'll also be able to track comments that you and others make.  gCamp may eventually replace all need for paper and pens in the entire world.  Well, maybe not, but it's going to be pretty cool.")

Your best option is to become super best friends with a gCamp developer.  They can be found in the hanging around gSchool during the day and hitting the hottest clubs at night.")

Functional, but our developers are going to continue to improve the sight for the foreseeable future.  Check in daily for new features and awesome functionality.  It's going to blow your mind.  Organization is only (well, will only) be a click away.  Amazing!")
